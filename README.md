# kwgeo
Tools for visualizing and manipulating geographic data in R

This is a personal R package to store functions I write for simplifying the process of geographic data processing and manipulation in R.  The package will generally include one-liners for accomplishing common tasks (e.g. uploading data to CartoDB, visualizing World Bank indicators with Leaflet), wrappers around existing spatial functions to make them simpler, or helper functions to do common tasks (e.g. transforming projected coordinates to WGS84).  

If you'd like, you can install the package with `devtools::install_github('walkerke/kwgeo')`.  A heads up - you may run into errors, as I am also using this to work through Hadley's book and learn package development.  Also, given the purpose of this package, it is dependency-heavy.
