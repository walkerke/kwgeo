# kwgeo
Tools for visualizing and manipulating geographic data in R

This is a personal R package to store functions I write for simplifying the process of geographic data processing and manipulation in R.  

If you'd like, you can install the package with `devtools::install_github('walkerke/kwgeo')`.  A heads up - you may run into errors, as I am also using this to work through Hadley's book and learn package development.
